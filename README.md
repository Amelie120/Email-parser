# Email-parser
A Python-based email parser that connects to a Gmail inbox via IMAP, retrieves emails, and extracts relevant text while filtering out unnecessary content. This script processes both plain text and HTML emails, cleans the extracted data, and identifies specific patterns such as order numbers or dates. IMAP must be enabled in Gmail settings for this script to function correctly.
